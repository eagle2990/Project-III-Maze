# VR Nanodegree
## Third Project

By Eduardo Alejandro Guzman Lau Len

This project took me around 8 days to develop (aprox. 4 hours per day). The easiest thing to do was placing the objects, while the hardest was coding the animations, specially because I wanted to use scripted animations, the main problem with it was making them move nicely.

Some things that took me a while to implement:
* Play sound while destroying the objects
* Finding the direction the Poof prefab was being created
* Creating the whole maze using an "organized" structure
* Animations using the UI are kind of hard for me, that's the reason I prefered to code it.

### Extra information

* Levitation and rotation scripts were created to avoid repeating the code
* There is an extra camera, it was used to test everything quickly without having to solve the maze first.
* The extra door and pillar were planning to be part of a "cheat" or "detour" that will be implemented in the future if the player does the Konami code moving their head.
* The "Maze Blueprint.xlsx" was used to help me design the maze.
